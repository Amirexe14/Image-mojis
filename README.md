# Image-mojis
Just fun emoji's to have on standby that you can send with 2 button presses

# What has your local programmer made now?
- It's a fun window that opens when you press the keybind you set in the code.
- When the window is open, feel free to click on any image to save them to your clipboard to send
- Then just press the set keybind to close the window again (Psst it wont get in your way i promise!)

# "Helllp, how it work? How download?"
## Fear not my fellow friend here's how to do all that:
- Right up there, yeah, you see that button that says "code"? Click it then hit the "download zip". It's that easy to download!!
- After you've downloaded it and extracted it to the point where you are in the folder of the script and the source folder (named "src") you can now tap yourself on the shoulder. Good work!
- Okidoki so now for the fun part, you see that folder named "src", its right next to the "main.py". Go inside that src folder and paste all the pictures you'd like to have as image-mojis
-
- (optional) Pssst bestie, you can change the keybinds by going inside "main.py" in either notepad or whatever and just located the "if keyboard.is_pressed('f4'):" and change the "f4" to a key on your keyboard!!
-
- Now all ya gotta do is run the main.py file with python!! (oh please tell me you that you know what python is)

## Nerd yapp:
- Btw if you get a missing module error when running the script then its most likely because you ARE missing a module, crazy right?
- Worry not as it is simple as pie, or in this case, one command.
- Run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal or cmd or powershell or whatevs to install those modules.
